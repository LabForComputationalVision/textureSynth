# textureSynth

This package contains MatLab code for analyzing and synthesizing digital
image of visual texture. The algorithm is described in the references
given at the bottom of this document. Further information, as well the
most recent versions of the code, are available at

    http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/texture/

Incremental changes to the code are documented in the `ChangeLog` file.

> [!TIP]

> An actively-maintained GPU-compatible python port of this model (using
> pytorch) can be found in the
> [plenoptic](https://github.com/LabForComputationalVision/plenoptic) package.
> Note that the `plenoptic` port is not exactly identical: it makes use of
> pytorch's built-in optimization, rather than the custom optimization found
> here, and it returns only the statistics described in the paper (this
> implementation includes some redundant statistics, see [plenoptic
> docs](https://plenoptic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/models/Metamer-Portilla-Simoncelli.html)
> for more details). The results of texture synthesis are still qualitatively
> similar.

> [!WARNING]
>
>  In https://github.com/LabForComputationalVision/textureSynth/pull/5, a small
>  change was made to the plotting code for compatibility with recent versions
>  of matlab. The code now works with Matlab >= 2023. Back-compatibility is
>  unclear.

## INSTALLATION

1)  download and unpack the code. You can put the code anywhere on your
    system, but we'll assume it's in a directory named `textureSynth`.

2)  download and unpack the [matlabPyrTools
    package](https://github.com/LabForComputationalVision/matlabPyrTools) This
    is a collection of tools for multi-scale decomposition of images. You can
    put the code anywhere on your system, but we'll assume it's in a directory
    named `matlabPyrTools`. Please use version 1.4 or newer of the
    matlabPyrTools.

3)  Run matlab, and put the matlabPyrTools directory in your path: >
    path('matlabPyrTools', path);

4)  The matlabPyrTools distribution includes a MEX subdirectory
    containing binary executables, precompiled for various platforms
    (SunOS,Solaris, Linux,Windows). You may need to recompile these on
    your platform. In addition, you should either move the relavent
    files from the MEX subdirectory into the main directory, OR create a
    link/alias to them, OR place the MEX subdirectory in your matlab
    path.

## USING THE SOFTWARE

-   To see a demonstration, start Matlab, change directories (using
    `cd`) into the textureSynth directory, and execute `example1`.

-   If you want to learn how to use the texture analysis and synthesis
    functions, take a look at example1.m and example2.m (these include
    many explanatory comments).

-   For a listing of matlab function included in this package, execute `help
    textureSynth`

-   For details on any of the functions, execute `help <name_of_function>`
